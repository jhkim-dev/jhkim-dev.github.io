A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.



```python
def isPalindrome(n):
    if(str(n) == str(n)[::-1]):
        return True
    
for a in range(999,100,-1):
    for b in range(999,100,-1):
        if isPalindrome(a*b):
            if max < a*b:
                max = a*b

print(max)
```

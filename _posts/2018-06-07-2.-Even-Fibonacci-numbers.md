Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



```python
# Fibonacci function(1,2,3,5,8,...)
def fib(n):
    a, b = 1, 2
    for i in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a

sum = 0
n = 1
while fib(n)<=4000000:
    if fib(n) % 2 == 0:
        sum += fib(n)
    n += 1
print(sum)
```

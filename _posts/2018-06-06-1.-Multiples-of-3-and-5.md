If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.



```python
sum = 0
i = 1
while i < 1000:
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        sum += i
    i += 1
print(sum)
```

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.



```python
def sumOfSquares(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        sum += i*i
    return sum

def squareOfSum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        sum += i
    return sum * sum
    
# Sum square difference 
def SSD(n):
    return squareOfSum(n)-sumOfSquares(n)

SSD(100)
```

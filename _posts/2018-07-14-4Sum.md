Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a,b,c and d in S such that a + b + c + d= target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

# Example
given array S = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], and target = 0.
A solution set is:
[
    [-1,0,0,1],
    [-2,-1,1,2],
    [-2,0,0,2]
]
```
